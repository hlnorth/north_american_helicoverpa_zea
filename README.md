# North American Helicoverpa zea (sampled 2019)

Population genomic analysis of North American Helicoverpa zea. I test for introgression, IbD, and signatures of selection. I then model directional selection at a locus of interest under the inferred selection coefficient to show that the coefficient estimate can explain shifts in allele frequency over the past ~20 years. Please do get in touch if you have any trouble running these scripts or if you spot any bugs.
