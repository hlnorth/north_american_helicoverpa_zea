# north_american_helicoverpa_zea
Population genomic analysis of North American Helicoverpa zea. I test for introgression, IbD, and signatures of selection. I then model directional selection at a locus of interest under the inferred selection coefficient to show that the coefficient estimate can explain shifts in allele frequency over the past ~20 years.
